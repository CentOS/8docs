//If your system does not have the ability to use the graphical mode, you can:
//
//. Use Kickstart to automate the installation as described in <<kickstart-install>>
//. Perform the graphical installation remotely by connecting to the installation system from another computer with a graphical display using the _VNC_ (Virtual Network Computing) protocol as described in <<put-id-here>>
//TODO: uncomment and finish links when available
