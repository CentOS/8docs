If your system does not have the ability to use the graphical mode, you can:

* Use Kickstart to automate the installation as described in xref:advanced-install:assembly_installation-introduction-experienced.adoc[Performing an automated installation using Kickstart]
* Perform the graphical installation remotely by connecting to the installation system from another computer with a graphical display using the _VNC_ (Virtual Network Computing) protocol as described in xref:advanced-install:assembly_performing-a-remote-installation-using-vnc.adoc[Performing a remote installation using VNC]
