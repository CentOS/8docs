Installing {productname} from the DVD1 ISO is the easiest and the recommended method of performing a standard RHEL installation. Other installation methods require additional setup and configuration. For example, when installing {productname} on a large number of systems simultaneously, the best approach is to boot from a PXE server and install from a source in a shared network location.

After you have created a bootable USB, DVD, or CD you are ready to boot the {productname} installation.
