[id="timezone-required_{context}"]
= timezone (required)

The [command]`timezone` Kickstart command is required. It sets the system time zone.


.Syntax

[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]``timezone __timezone__ [__options__]``
----


.Mandatory options

* __timezone__ - the time zone to set for the system.


.Optional options

* [option]`--utc` - If present, the system assumes the hardware clock is set to UTC (Greenwich Mean) time.

* [option]`--nontp` - Disable the NTP service automatic starting.

* [option]`--ntpservers=` - Specify a list of NTP servers to be used as a comma-separated list without spaces.


.Notes

In {rel8}, time zone names are validated using the `pytz.all_timezones` list, provided by the [package]*pytz* package. In previous releases, the names were validated against `pytz.common_timezones`, which is a subset of the currently used list. Note that the graphical and text mode interfaces still use the more restricted `pytz.common_timezones` list; you must use a Kickstart file to use additional time zone definitions.
