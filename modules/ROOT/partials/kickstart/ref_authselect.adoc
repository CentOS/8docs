.Notes

* This command passes all options to the [command]`authselect` command. Refer to the __authselect(8)__ manual page and the [command]`authselect --help` command for more details.

* This command replaces the deprecated [command]`auth` or [command]`authconfig` commands deprecated in {RHEL8} together with the [command]`authconfig` tool.

* Passwords are shadowed by default.

* When using OpenLDAP with the `SSL` protocol for security, make sure that the `SSLv2` and `SSLv3` protocols are disabled in the server configuration. This is due to the POODLE SSL vulnerability (CVE-2014-3566). See link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1234843[] for details.
