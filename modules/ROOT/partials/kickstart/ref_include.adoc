[id="include_{context}"]
= %include

The [command]`%include` Kickstart command is optional.

Use the [command]``%include __/path/to/file__`` command to include the contents of another file in the Kickstart file as though the contents were at the location of the [command]`%include` command in the Kickstart file.

This inclusion is evaluated only after the `%pre` script sections and can thus be used for files generated by scripts in the `%pre` sections. To include files before evaluation of `%pre` sections, use the [command]`%ksappend` command.
