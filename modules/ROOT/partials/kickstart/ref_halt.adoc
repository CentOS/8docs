[id="halt_{context}"]
= halt

The [command]`halt` Kickstart command is optional.

Halt the system after the installation has successfully completed. This is similar to a manual installation, where Anaconda displays a message and waits for the user to press a key before rebooting. During a Kickstart installation, if no completion method is specified, this option is used as the default.


.Notes

* The [command]`halt` command is equivalent to the [command]`shutdown -H` command. For more details, see the _shutdown(8)_ man page.

* For other completion methods, see the [command]`poweroff`, [command]`reboot`, and [command]`shutdown` commands.
