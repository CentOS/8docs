[command]`cdrom`

.Notes

* Previously, the [command]`cdrom` command had to be used together with the [command]`install` command. The [command]`install` command has been deprecated and [command]`cdrom` can be used on its own, because it implies [command]`install`.

* This command has no options.

* To actually run the installation, one of `cdrom`, `harddrive`, `hmc`, `nfs`, `liveimg`, or `url` must be specified.
