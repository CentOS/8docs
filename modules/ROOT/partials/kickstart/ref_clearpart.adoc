[id="clearpart_{context}"]
= clearpart

The [command]`clearpart` Kickstart command is optional. It removes partitions from the system, prior to creation of new partitions. By default, no partitions are removed.

// For a detailed example of partitioning including the [command]`clearpart` command, see xnotref:sect-kickstart-partitioning-example[].

.Options

* [option]`--all` - Erases all partitions from the system.
+
This option will erase all disks which can be reached by the installation program, including any attached network storage. Use this option with caution.
+
You can prevent [command]`clearpart` from wiping storage you want to preserve by using the [option]`--drives=` option and specifying only the drives you want to clear, by attaching network storage later (for example, in the [command]`%post` section of the Kickstart file), or by blacklisting the kernel modules used to access network storage.

* [option]`--drives=` - Specifies which drives to clear partitions from. For example, the following clears all the partitions on the first two drives on the primary IDE controller:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`clearpart --drives=hda,hdb --all`
----
+
To clear a multipath device, use the format ``disk/by-id/scsi-__WWID__``, where __WWID__ is the world-wide identifier for the device. For example, to clear a disk with WWID `58095BEC5510947BE8C0360F604351918`, use:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`clearpart --drives=disk/by-id/scsi-58095BEC5510947BE8C0360F604351918`
----
+
This format is preferable for all multipath devices, but if errors arise, multipath devices that do not use logical volume management (LVM) can also be cleared using the format ``disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-__WWID__``, where __WWID__ is the world-wide identifier for the device. For example, to clear a disk with WWID `2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017`, use:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`clearpart --drives=disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017`
----
+
Never specify multipath devices by device names like `mpatha`. Device names such as this are not specific to a particular disk. The disk named [filename]`/dev/mpatha` during installation might not be the one that you expect it to be. Therefore, the [command]`clearpart` command could target the wrong disk.

* [option]`--initlabel` - Initializes a disk (or disks) by creating a default disk label for all disks in their respective architecture that have been designated for formatting (for example, msdos for x86). Because [option]`--initlabel` can see all disks, it is important to ensure only those drives that are to be formatted are connected.
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`clearpart --initlabel --drives=names_of_disks`
----
+
For example:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`clearpart --initlabel --drives=dasda,dasdb,dasdc`
----

* [option]`--list=` - Specifies which partitions to clear. This option overrides the [option]`--all` and [option]`--linux` options if used. Can be used across different drives. For example:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`clearpart --list=sda2,sda3,sdb1`
----

* [option]`--disklabel=_LABEL_` - Set the default disklabel to use. Only disklabels supported for the platform will be accepted. For example, on the 64-bit Intel and AMD architectures, the `msdos` and `gpt` disklabels are accepted, but `dasd` is not accepted.

* [option]`--linux` - Erases all Linux partitions.

* [option]`--none` (default) - Do not remove any partitions.

* [option]`--cdl` - Reformat any LDL DASDs to CDL format.

.Notes

// * Using the [command]`clearpart --all` command in a Kickstart file to remove all existing partitions during the installation can cause Anaconda to pause and prompt you for a confirmation in certain cases. If you need to perform the installation automatically with no interaction, add the [command]`zerombr` command to your Kickstart file.

* Device names in the ``sd__X__`` (or ``/dev/sd__X__``) format are not guaranteed to be consistent across reboots, which can complicate usage of some Kickstart commands. When a command calls for a device node name, you can instead use any item from [filename]`/dev/disk`. For example, instead of:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=sda1`
----
+
You could use an entry similar to one of the following:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:05.0-scsi-0:0:0:0-part1`
----
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST3160815AS_6RA0C882-part1`
----
+
This way the command will always target the same storage device. This is especially useful in large storage environments. See the chapter link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_storage_devices/assembly_overview-of-persistent-naming-attributes_managing-storage-devices[Overview of persistent naming attributes] in the __Managing storage devices in RHEL 8__ document for more in-depth information about different ways to consistently refer to storage devices.

* If the [command]`clearpart` command is used, then the [command]`part --onpart` command cannot be used on a logical partition.
