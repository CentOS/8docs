The [command]`nfs` Kickstart command is optional. It performs the installation from a specified NFS server.


.Syntax

[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`nfs`
----


.Options

* [option]`--server=` - Server from which to install (host name or IP).

* [option]`--dir=` - Directory containing the [filename]`__variant__` directory of the installation tree.

* [option]`--opts=` - Mount options to use for mounting the NFS export. (optional)


.Example

[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`nfs --server=nfsserver.example.com --dir=/tmp/install-tree`
----


.Notes

* Previously, the [command]`nfs` command had to be used together with the [command]`install` command. The [command]`install` command has been deprecated and [command]`nfs` can be used on its own, because it implies [command]`install`.

* To actually run the installation, one of `cdrom`, `harddrive`, `hmc`, `nfs`, `liveimg`, or `url` must be specified.
