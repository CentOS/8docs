[id="ignoredisk_{context}"]
= ignoredisk

The [command]`ignoredisk` Kickstart command is optional. It causes the installation program to ignore the specified disks.

This is useful if you use automatic partitioning and want to be sure that some disks are ignored. For example, without [command]`ignoredisk`, attempting to deploy on a SAN-cluster the Kickstart would fail, as the installation program detects passive paths to the SAN that return no partition table.


.Syntax

[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]``ignoredisk --drives=__drive1,drive2__,... | --only-use=_drive_``
----


.Options

* [option]`--drives=__driveN__,...` - Replace __driveN__ with one of `sda`, `sdb`,..., `hda`,... and so on.

* [option]`--only-use` - Specifies a list of disks for the installation program to use. All other disks are ignored. For example, to use disk `sda` during installation and ignore all other disks:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`ignoredisk --only-use=sda`
----
+
To include a multipath device that does not use LVM:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`ignoredisk --only-use=disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017`
----
+
To include a multipath device that uses LVM:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`ignoredisk --only-use=disk/by-id/scsi-58095BEC5510947BE8C0360F604351918`
----

You must specify one of the [option]`--drives` and [option]`--only-use`.

.Notes

* The [option]`--interactive` option is deprecated in {rel8}. This option allowed users to manually navigate the advanced storage screen.

* To ignore a multipath device that does not use logical volume management (LVM), use the format ``disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-__WWID__``, where __WWID__ is the world-wide identifier for the device. For example, to ignore a disk with WWID `2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017`, use:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`ignoredisk --drives=disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017`
----

* Multipath devices that use LVM are not assembled until after Anaconda has parsed the Kickstart file. Therefore, you cannot specify these devices in the format `dm-uuid-mpath`. Instead, to ignore a multipath device that uses LVM, use the format ``disk/by-id/scsi-__WWID__``, where __WWID__ is the world-wide identifier for the device. For example, to ignore a disk with WWID `58095BEC5510947BE8C0360F604351918`, use:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`ignoredisk --drives=disk/by-id/scsi-58095BEC5510947BE8C0360F604351918`
----

* Never specify multipath devices by device names like `mpatha`. Device names such as this are not specific to a particular disk. The disk named [filename]`/dev/mpatha` during installation might not be the one that you expect it to be. Therefore, the [command]`clearpart` command could target the wrong disk.

* Device names in the ``sd__X__`` (or ``/dev/sd__X__``) format are not guaranteed to be consistent across reboots, which can complicate usage of some Kickstart commands. When a command calls for a device node name, you can instead use any item from [filename]`/dev/disk`. For example, instead of:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=sda1`
----
+
You can use an entry similar to one of the following:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:05.0-scsi-0:0:0:0-part1`
----
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST3160815AS_6RA0C882-part1`
----
+
This way the command will always target the same storage device. This is especially useful in large storage environments. See the chapter link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_storage_devices/assembly_overview-of-persistent-naming-attributes_managing-storage-devices[Overview of persistent naming attributes] in the __Managing storage devices in RHEL 8__ document for more in-depth information about different ways to consistently refer to storage devices.
