.Options

* [option]`--non-interactive` - Performs the installation in a completely non-interactive mode. This mode will terminate the installation when user interaction is required.


.Notes

* Note that for a fully automatic installation, you must either specify one of the available modes ([command]`graphical`, [command]`text`, or [command]`cmdline`) in the Kickstart file, or you must use the [option]`console=` boot option. If no mode is specified, the system will use graphical mode if possible, or prompt you to choose from VNC and text mode.

// you must use the [option]`console=` boot option as described in xnotref:list-boot-options-display[].
