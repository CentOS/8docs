[id="services_{context}"]
= services

The [command]`services` Kickstart command is optional. It modifies the default set of services that will run under the default systemd target. The list of disabled services is processed before the list of enabled services. Therefore, if a service appears on both lists, it will be enabled.

.Syntax

[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]``services [--disabled=__list__] [--enabled=__list__]``
----

.Options

* [option]`--disabled=` - Disable the services given in the comma separated list.

* [option]`--enabled=` - Enable the services given in the comma separated list.

.Notes

*Do not include spaces in the list of services. If you do, Kickstart will enable or disable only the services up to the first space. For example:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`services --disabled=auditd, cups,smartd, nfslock`
----
+
That disables only the `auditd` service. To disable all four services, this entry must include no spaces:
+
[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]`services --disabled=auditd,cups,smartd,nfslock`
----
