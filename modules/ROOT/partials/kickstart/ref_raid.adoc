= raid

The [command]`raid` Kickstart command is optional. It assembles a software RAID device.


.Syntax

[subs="quotes,macros"]
----
[command]``raid __mntpoint__ --level=__level__ --device=__device-name__ __partitions*__``
----


.Options

* __mntpoint__ - Location where the RAID file system is mounted. If it is [filename]`/`, the RAID level must be 1 unless a boot partition ([filename]`/boot`) is present. If a boot partition is present, the [filename]`/boot` partition must be level 1 and the root ([filename]`/`) partition can be any of the available types. The __partitions*__ (which denotes that multiple partitions can be listed) lists the RAID identifiers to add to the RAID array.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
On IBM Power{nbsp}Systems, if a RAID device has been prepared and has not been reformatted during the installation, ensure that the RAID metadata version is `0.90` if you intend to put the [filename]`/boot` and [filename]`PReP` partitions on the RAID device.

The default {ProductName}{nbsp}7 `mdadm` metadata version is not supported for the boot device.
====
+
// For a detailed example of [command]`raid` in action, see xnotref:sect-kickstart-partitioning-example[].

* [option]`--level=` - RAID level to use (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 10). See xref:assembly_partitioning-reference.adoc#supported-raid-types_partitioning-reference[Supported RAID types] for information about various available RAID levels.

* [option]`--device=` - Name of the RAID device to use - for example, [option]`--device=root`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use `mdraid` names in the form of `md0` - these names are not guaranteed to be persistent. Instead, use meaningful names such as `root` or `swap`. Using meaningful names creates a symbolic link from [filename]`/dev/md/__name__` to whichever [filename]`/dev/md__X__` node is assigned to the array.

If you have an old (v0.90 metadata) array that you cannot assign a name to, you can specify the array by a filesystem label or UUID (for example, [option]`--device=centos-root --label=centos-root`).
====

* [option]`--chunksize=` - Sets the chunk size of a RAID storage in KiB. In certain situations, using a different chunk size than the default ([option]`512 Kib`) can improve the performance of the RAID.

* [option]`--spares=` - Specifies the number of spare drives allocated for the RAID array. Spare drives are used to rebuild the array in case of drive failure.

* [option]`--fsprofile=` - Specifies a usage type to be passed to the program that makes a filesystem on this partition. A usage type defines a variety of tuning parameters to be used when making a filesystem. For this option to work, the filesystem must support the concept of usage types and there must be a configuration file that lists valid types. For ext2, ext3, and ext4, this configuration file is [filename]`/etc/mke2fs.conf`.

* [option]`--fstype=` - Sets the file system type for the RAID array. Valid values are `xfs`, `ext2`, `ext3`, `ext4`, `swap`, and `vfat`.

* [option]`--fsoptions=` - Specifies a free form string of options to be used when mounting the filesystem. This string will be copied into the [filename]`/etc/fstab` file of the installed system and should be enclosed in quotes.

* [option]`--mkfsoptions=` - Specifies additional parameters to be passed to the program that makes a filesystem on this partition. No processing is done on the list of arguments, so they must be supplied in a format that can be passed directly to the mkfs program. This means multiple options should be comma-separated or surrounded by double quotes, depending on the filesystem.

* [option]`--label=` - Specify the label to give to the filesystem to be made. If the given label is already in use by another filesystem, a new label will be created.

* [option]`--noformat` - Use an existing RAID device and do not format the RAID array.

* [option]`--useexisting` - Use an existing RAID device and reformat it.

* [option]`--encrypted` - Specifies that this RAID device should be encrypted with Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS), using the passphrase provided in the [option]`--passphrase` option. If you do not specify a passphrase, Anaconda uses the default, system-wide passphrase set with the [command]`autopart --passphrase` command, or stops the installation and prompts you to provide a passphrase if no default is set.
+
[NOTE]
====
When encrypting one or more partitions, Anaconda attempts to gather 256 bits of entropy to ensure the partitions are encrypted securely. Gathering entropy can take some time - the process will stop after a maximum of 10 minutes, regardless of whether sufficient entropy has been gathered.

The process can be sped up by interacting with the installation system (typing on the keyboard or moving the mouse). If you are installing in a virtual machine, you can also attach a `virtio-rng` device (a virtual random number generator) to the guest.
====

* [option]`--luks-version=_LUKS_VERSION_` - Specifies which version of LUKS format should be used to encrypt the filesystem. This option is only meaningful if [option]`--encrypted` is specified.

* [option]`--cipher=` - Specifies the type of encryption to use if the Anaconda default `aes-xts-plain64` is not satisfactory. You must use this option together with the [option]`--encrypted` option; by itself it has no effect. Available types of encryption are listed in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/security_hardening/index[Security hardening in RHEL 8] document, but {RH} strongly recommends using either `aes-xts-plain64` or `aes-cbc-essiv:sha256`.

* [option]`--passphrase=` - Specifies the passphrase to use when encrypting this RAID device. You must use this option together with the [option]`--encrypted` option; by itself it has no effect.

* [option]`--escrowcert=__URL_of_X.509_certificate__` - Store the data encryption key for this device in a file in [filename]`/root`, encrypted using the X.509 certificate from the URL specified with __URL_of_X.509_certificate__. This option is only meaningful if [option]`--encrypted` is specified.

* [option]`--backuppassphrase` - Add a randomly-generated passphrase to this device. Store the passphrase in a file in [filename]`/root`, encrypted using the X.509 certificate specified with [option]`--escrowcert`. This option is only meaningful if [option]`--escrowcert` is specified.

* [option]`--pbkdf=_PBKDF_` - Sets Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF) algorithm for LUKS keyslot. See also the man page _cryptsetup(8)_. This option is only meaningful if [option]`--encrypted` is specified.

* [option]`--pbkdf-memory=__PBKDF_MEMORY__` - Sets the memory cost for PBKDF.  See also the man page _cryptsetup(8)_. This option is only meaningful if [option]`--encrypted` is specified.

* [option]`--pbkdf-time=__PBKDF_TIME__` - Sets the number of milliseconds to spend with PBKDF passphrase processing. See also [option]`--iter-time` in the man page _cryptsetup(8)_. This option is only meaningful if [option]`--encrypted` is specified, and is mutually exclusive with [option]`--pbkdf-iterations`.

* [option]`--pbkdf-iterations=__PBKDF_ITERATIONS__` - Sets the number of iterations directly and avoids PBKDF benchmark. See also [option]`--pbkdf-force-iterations` in the man page _cryptsetup(8)_. This option is only meaningful if [option]`--encrypted` is specified, and is mutually exclusive with [option]`--pbkdf-time`.


.Example

The following example shows how to create a RAID level 1 partition for [filename]`/`, and a RAID level 5 for [filename]`/home`, assuming there are three SCSI disks on the system. It also creates three swap partitions, one on each drive.

.Notes

* If you lose the LUKS passphrase, any encrypted partitions and their data is completely inaccessible. There is no way to recover a lost passphrase. However, you can save encryption passphrases with the [option]`--escrowcert` and create backup encryption passphrases with the [option]`--backuppassphrase` options.
