= Installing a package

// User Story: As a sysadmin, I need to know how to find and install RPMs, SCLs, and modules using AppStream so I can ensure that I have the modules I need.

This section describes how to install packages.


.Procedure

* Install the package:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
# yum install __package__
----
+
====

* If the package is not provided by any module stream, this procedure is identical to the procedure used on previous versions of {ProductName}.

* If the package is provided by an module stream that is enabled, the package is installed without any further manipulation.

* If the package is provided by a module stream marked as default, the [command]`yum` tool automatically transparently enables that module stream before installing this package.

* If the package is provided by a module stream that is not active (neither of the above cases), it is not recognized until you manually enable the respective module stream.
