= Selecting a stream before installation of packages

Default module streams ensure that users can install packages without caring about the modular features. When the user wants packages with version from a non-default stream, that stream must be enabled before packages provided by it can be installed.


.Prerequisites

* You must understand the xref:assembly_introduction-to-modules.adoc#module-streams_introduction-to-modules[concept of an _active module stream_].

.Procedure

* Enable the module stream:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
# yum module enable __module-name__:__stream__
----
+
Replace _module-name_ and _stream_ with names of the module and stream.
+
[command]`yum` asks for confirmation and the stream is enabled and active. If another stream of the module was previously active (default or enabled), it is no longer active.
