= Listing available modules

// User Story: As a sysadmin, I need to know what is available through the AppStream so I can determine what RPMs, SCLs, and modules to download and install.

This section describes steps needed for finding what modules are available and what their details are.

.Procedure

. List module streams available to your system:
+
----
$ yum module list
----
+
The output of this command lists module streams with name, stream, profiles, and summary on a separate line.

. Display details about a module, including a description, a list of all profiles, and a list of all provided packages:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
$ yum module info __module-name__
----

. Optional: You can also list which of these packages are installed by each of module profiles:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
$ yum module info --profile __module-name__
----

. Display the current status of a module, including enabled streams and installed profiles:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
$ yum module list __module-name__
----
