= Package management using YUM in {ProductShortName} {ProductNumber}

// User Story: As a sysadmin, I need to know what is available through the AppStream so I can determine what RPMs, SCLs, and modules to download and install.

The [application]*YUM* package management tool is now based on the DNF technology and it adds support for the new modular features.

Usage of [application]*YUM* has not been changed when handling individual RPM packages. For handling the modular content, the [command]`yum module` command has been added.

See xref:assembly_installing-rhel-8-content.adoc[Installing {ProductName} Content] for additional details.


Where required, the modular functionality automatically selects the appropriate combination of modules and streams to enable installation of logical sets of packages for convenient usage.
