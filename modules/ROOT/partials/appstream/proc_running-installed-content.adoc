= Running installed content

// User Story: As a sysadmin, I need to know how to run the RPMs, SCLs, and modules I've pulled from the AppStream.

Usually, after you install content from {rel8} repositories, new commands will be enabled. If the commands originated from a RPM package or RPM packages enabled by a module the experience of using the command should be no different. To run the new commands use them directly:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ _command_
----

////
.Software Collections
To run installed content packaged as a Software Collection, use the [command]`scl enable` command from the [package]*scl-utils* package:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
$ scl enable __collection__ '__command__'
----
+
Replace _collection_ with the name of the Software Collection. Refer to documentation for the particular Software Collection to find this value.
+
NOTE: A Software Collection's name is usually identical to name of its package.
