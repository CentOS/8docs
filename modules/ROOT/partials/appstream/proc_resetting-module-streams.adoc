= Resetting module streams

Resetting a module is an action that returns all of its streams to their initial state - neither enabled nor disabled. If the module has a default stream, that stream becomes active as a result of resetting the module.


.Procedure

* Reset the module state:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
# yum module reset __module-name__
----
+
All streams of the module are returned to the initial state. No installed content is removed.
