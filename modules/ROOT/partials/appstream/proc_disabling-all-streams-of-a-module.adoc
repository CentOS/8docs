= Disabling all streams of a module

Modules which have a default stream will always have one stream active. In situations where the content from all the module streams should not be accessible, it is possible to disable the whole module.


.Prerequisites

* You must understand the xref:assembly_introduction-to-modules.adoc#module-streams_introduction-to-modules[concept of an _active module stream_].

.Procedure

* Disable the module:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
# yum module disable _module-name_
----
+
[command]`yum` asks for confirmation and then disables the module with all its streams. All of the module streams become inactive. No installed content is removed.
