You can install {productname} on a large variety of storage devices. You can configure basic, locally accessible, storage devices in the *Installation Destination* window. Basic storage devices directly connected to the local system, such as hard disk drives and solid-state drives, are displayed in the *Local Standard Disks* section of the window.
On IBM Z, this section contains activated Direct Access Storage Devices (DASDs).

[WARNING]
====
A known issue prevents DASDs configured as HyperPAV aliases from being automatically attached to the system after the installation is complete. These storage devices are available during the installation, but are not immediately accessible after you finish installing and reboot. To attach HyperPAV alias devices, add them manually to the `/etc/dasd.conf` configuration file of the system.
