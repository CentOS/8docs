= The boot menu

Once your system has completed loading the boot media, a boot menu is displayed using [application]*GRand Unified Bootloader*, version 2 ([application]*GRUB2*) . The boot menu provides several options in addition to launching the installation program. If no key is pressed within 60 seconds, the default boot option (the one highlighted in white) will be run. To choose the default, either wait for the timer to run out or press kbd:[Enter].
