= Performing a driver update during installation

At the very beginning of the installation process, you can perform a driver update in the following ways:

* Let the installation program automatically find and offer a driver update for installation,

* Let the installation program prompt you to locate a driver update,

* Manually specify a path to a driver update image or an RPM package.

[IMPORTANT]
====

Always make sure to put your driver update discs on a standard disk partition. Advanced storage, such as RAID or LVM volumes, might not be accessible during the early stage of the installation when you perform driver updates.
