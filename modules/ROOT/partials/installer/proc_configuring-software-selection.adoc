// TODO reformat the file?

Use the *Software Selection* window to select the software packages that you require. The packages are organized by Base Environments and Add-Ons.

* *Base Environments* are predefined packages. You can select only one base environment, and availability is dependent on the installation ISO image used as the installation source.

* *Add-Ons* are additional packages for the base environment. You can select multiple add-ons.

Use the predefined environments and add-ons to customize your system, but in a standard installation, you cannot select individual packages to install. To view the packages contained in a specific environment or add-on, see the [filename]`__repository__/repodata/*-comps-__repository__.__architecture__.xml` file on your installation source media (DVD, CD, USB). The XML file contains details of the packages installed as part of a base environment or add-on. Available environments are marked by the `<environment>` tag, and add-ons are marked by the `<group>` tag.

If you are unsure about which packages to install, {OrgName} recommends that you select the *Minimal Install* base environment. Minimal install installs a basic version of {productname} with only a minimal amount of additional software. After the system finishes installing and you log in for the first time, you can use the *Yum package manager* to install additional software.
For more information about Yum package manager, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_basic_system_settings/index/[_Configuring basic system settings in RHEL 8_] document.

[NOTE]
====
* The `yum group list` command lists all package groups from yum repositories. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_basic_system_settings/index/[_Configuring basic system settings in RHEL 8_] document for more information.

* If you need to control which packages are installed, you can use a Kickstart file and define the packages in the `%packages` section. See the xref:advanced-install:index.adoc[_Performing an advanced installation_] document for information about installing {productname} using Kickstart.
