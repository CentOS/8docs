= Assisted driver update

It is always recommended to have a block device with the `OEMDRV` volume label available to install a driver during installation. However, if no such device is detected and the [option]`inst.dd` option was specified at the boot command line, the installation program lets you find the driver disk in interactive mode.

. First, select a local disk partition from the list for [application]*Anaconda* to scan for ISO files.
. Then, select one of the detected ISO files.
. Finally, select one or more available drivers. The image below demonstrates the process in the text user interface with individual steps highlighted.

[NOTE]
====

If you extracted your ISO image file and burned it on a CD or DVD but the media does not have the `OEMDRV` volume label, either use the [option]`inst.dd` option with no arguments and use the menu to select the device, or use the following boot option for the installation program to scan the media for drivers:

[literal,subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
....
inst.dd=/dev/sr0
....

Press the number keys to toggle selection on individual drivers. When ready, press kbd:[c] to install the selected drivers and proceed to the [application]*Anaconda* graphical user interface.
