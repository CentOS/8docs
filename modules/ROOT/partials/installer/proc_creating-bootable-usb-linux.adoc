= Creating a bootable USB device on Linux

Follow this procedure to create a bootable USB device on a Linux system.

[discrete]
== Prerequisites

* You have downloaded an installation ISO image as described in xref:standard-install:assembly_preparing-for-your-installation.adoc#downloading-beta-installation-images_preparing-for-your-installation[Downloading the installation ISO image].
* The *DVD1* ISO image is larger than 4.7 GB, so you must have a USB flash drive that is large enough to hold the ISO image.

== Procedure

[NOTE]
====
This procedure is destructive and data on the USB flash drive is destroyed without a warning.
====

. Connect the USB flash drive to the system.

. Open a terminal window and run the `dmesg` command:
+
[subs="quotes, macros, attributes"]
----
$ dmesg|tail
----
+
The `dmesg` command returns a log that details all recent events. Messages resulting from the attached USB flash drive are displayed at the bottom of the log. Record the name of the connected device.

. Switch to user root:
+
[subs="quotes, macros, attributes"]
----
$ su -
----

. Enter your root password when prompted.

. Find the device node assigned to the drive. In this example, the drive name is `sdd`.

----

. Run the `dd` command to write the ISO image directly to the USB device.
+
[subs="macros"]
----
# dd if=/image_directory/image.iso of=/dev/device
----
+
Replace _/image_directory/image.iso_ with the full path to the ISO image file that you downloaded, and replace _device_ with the device name that you retrieved with the `dmesg` command. In this example, the full path to the ISO image is `/home/testuser/Downloads/{ProductName}-{ProductNumber}-x86_64-boot.iso`, and the device name is `sdd`:
+
[subs="quotes, macros, attributes"]
----
# [command]#dd# if=/home/testuser/Downloads/{ProductName}-{ProductNumber}-x86_64-boot.iso of=/dev/sdd
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that you use the correct device name, and not the name of a partition on the device. Partition names are usually device names with a numerical suffix. For example, `sdd` is a device name, and `sdd1` is the name of a partition on the device `sdd`.
====

. Wait for the `dd` command to finish writing the image to the device. The data transfer is complete when the *#* prompt appears. When the prompt is displayed, log out of the root account and unplug the USB drive. The USB drive is now ready to be used as a boot device.
