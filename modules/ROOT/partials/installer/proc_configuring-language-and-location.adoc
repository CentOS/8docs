= Configuring language and location settings

The installation program uses the language that you select during installation, and on the installed system.

.Prerequisites
. You created installation media. See xref:standard-install:assembly_preparing-for-your-installation.adoc#making-media_preparing-for-your-installation[Creating installation media] for more information.
. You specified an installation source if you are using the Boot ISO image file. See xref:standard-install:assembly_preparing-for-your-installation.adoc#prepare-installation-source_preparing-for-your-installation[Preparing an installation source] for more information.
. You booted the installation. See xref:standard-install:assembly_booting-installer.adoc[Booting the installation] for more information.

.Procedure

. From the left-hand pane of the *Welcome to {ProductName}* window, select a language. Alternatively, type your preferred language into the *Search* field.

[NOTE]
====
A language is pre-selected by default. If network access is configured, that is, if you booted from a network server instead of local media, the pre-selected language is determined by the automatic location detection feature of the *GeoIP* module. If you used the [option]`inst.lang=` option on the boot command line or in your PXE server configuration, then the language that you define with the boot option is selected.
====

. From the right-hand pane of the *Welcome to {ProductName}* window, select a location specific to your region.

. Click btn:[Continue] to proceed to the xref:standard-install:assembly_graphical-installation.adoc#installation-summary_graphical-installation[The Installation Summary window] window.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are installing a pre-release version of {ProductName}, a warning message is displayed about the pre-release status of the installation media. Click *I want to proceed* to continue with the installation, or *I want to exit* to quit the installation and reboot the system.
