= Using virtual SCSI

If you are using virtual SCSI resources, rather than native SCSI, a 'link' must be configured to the virtual SCSI serving partition, then configure the virtual SCSI serving partition itself. You create a 'link' between the virtual SCSI client and server slots using the HMC. You can configure a virtual SCSI server on either Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) or IBM{nbsp}i, depending on which model and options you have.

If you are installing using Intel iSCSI Remote Boot, all attached iSCSI storage devices must be disabled. Otherwise, the installation will succeed but the installed system will not boot.

For more information on using virtual devices, see the IBM Redbooks publication _Virtualizing an Infrastructure with System p and Linux_ at: link:++http://publib-b.boulder.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247499.html++[http://publib-b.boulder.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247499.html]
