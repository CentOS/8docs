= Creating a bootable DVD or CD
//TODO: This really isn't a procedure. Need to change post-beta.

You can create a bootable installation DVD or CD using burning software and a CD/DVD burner. The exact steps to produce a DVD or CD from an ISO image file vary greatly, depending on the operating system and disc burning software installed. Consult your system's burning software documentation for the exact steps to burn a CD or DVD from an ISO image file.

[WARNING]
====
You can create a bootable DVD or CD using either the DVD1 ISO image (contains installer and packages), or the Boot ISO image (only contains the installer, requires an additional package source). However, the DVD1 ISO image is larger than 4.7{nbsp}GB, and as a result, it might not fit on a single-layer DVD. A dual-layer DVD or USB key is recommended when using the DVD1 ISO image to create bootable installation media.
