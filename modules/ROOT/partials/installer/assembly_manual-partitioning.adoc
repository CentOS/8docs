You can use manual partitioning to configure your disk partitions and mount points and define the file system that {ProductName} is installed on.

[NOTE]
====
Before installation, you should consider whether you want to use partitioned or unpartitioned disk devices. For more information, see the Knowledgebase article at https://access.redhat.com/solutions/163853.
====

An installation of {ProductName} requires a minimum of one partition but {OrgName} recommends using at least the following partitions or volumes: `PReP`, `/`, `/home`, `/boot`, and `swap`. You can also create additional partitions and volumes as you require.

[NOTE]
====
An installation of {productname} on IBM Power Systems servers requires a `PReP` boot partition.

WARNING: To prevent data loss it is recommended that you back up your data before proceeding. If you are upgrading or creating a dual-boot system, you should back up any data you want to keep on your storage devices.
