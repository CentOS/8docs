= Starting a Kickstart installation automatically using a local volume

You can start a Kickstart installation by putting a Kickstart file with a specific name on a specifically labelled storage volume.


.Prerequisites

* You must have a volume prepared with xref:assembly_making-kickstart-files-available-to-the-installation-program.adoc#making-a-kickstart-file-available-on-a-local-volume-for-automatic-loading_making-kickstart-files-available-to-the-installation-program[label `OEMDRV` and the Kickstart file present in its root as `ks.cfg`].

* A drive containing this volume must be available on the system as the installation program boots.


.Procedure

. Boot the system using a local media (a CD, DVD, or a USB flash drive).

. At the boot prompt, specify the required boot options.

..  If a required repository is in a network location, you may need to configure the network using the [option]`ip=` option. The installer tries to configure all network devices using the DHCP protocol by default without this option.

..  In order to access a software source from which necessary packages will be installed, you may need to add the [option]`inst.repo=` option. If you do not specify this option, you must specify the installation source in the Kickstart file.

.  Start the installation by confirming your added boot options.
+
The installation begins now, and the Kickstart file is automatically detected and used to start an automated Kickstart installation.
