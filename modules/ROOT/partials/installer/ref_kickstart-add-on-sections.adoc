= Kickstart add-on sections

Starting with {ProductName} 7, Kickstart installations support add-ons. These add-ons can expand the basic Kickstart (and Anaconda) functionality in many ways.

To use an add-on in your Kickstart file, use the `%addon __addon_name__ __options__` command, and finish the command with an `%end` statement, similar to pre-installation and post-installation script sections. For example, if you want to use the Kdump add-on, which is distributed with Anaconda by default, use the following commands:

----
%addon com_redhat_kdump --enable --reserve-mb=auto
%end
----

The `%addon` command does not include any options of its own - all options are dependent on the actual add-on.
// For more information about add-ons, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Anaconda Customization Guide.
