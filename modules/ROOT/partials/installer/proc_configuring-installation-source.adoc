= Configuring installation source

Follow the steps in this procedure to configure the DVD1 ISO image as the installation source, which is the *recommended* method of installing {productname}.

.Prerequisites


// this is for within the title
* You have downloaded the DVD1 ISO image as detailed in xref:standard-install:assembly_preparing-for-your-installation.adoc#downloading-beta-installation-images_preparing-for-your-installation[Downloading the installation ISO image].
* You have created bootable installation media as detailed in xref:standard-install:assembly_preparing-for-your-installation.adoc#making-media_preparing-for-your-installation[Creating installation media].
* The *Installation Summary* window is open.

[NOTE]
====
When the *Installation Summary* window first opens, the installation program attempts to configure an installation source based on the type of media that was used to boot the system. The full {ProductName} Server DVD configures the source as local media.
====
//TODO: based on comment from Martin in google doc review of graphical install.

.Procedure

. From the *Installation Summary* window, click *Installation Source*. The *Installation Source* window opens.

.. Review the *Auto-detected installation* section to verify the details. This option is selected by default if you started the installation program from media containing an installation source, for example, a DVD.

.. Click *Verify* to check the media integrity.

.. Review the *Additional repositories* section and note that the *Appstream* checkbox is selected by default.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
* *No additional configuration is necessary as the BaseOS and Appstream repositories are installed as part of the full installation image.*
* *Do not disable the Appstream repository check box if you want a full {rel8} installation.*
====

. Select the *On the network* option to download and install packages from a network location instead of local media.
+
[NOTE]
====
* If you do not want to download and install additional repositories from a network location, proceed to xref:standard-install:assembly_graphical-installation.adoc#configuring-software-selection_configuring-software-settings[Configuring software selection].
* This option is available only when a network connection is active. See xref:standard-install:assembly_graphical-installation.adoc#network-hostname_configuring-system-settings[Configuring network and host name options] for information about how to configure network connections in the GUI.
====

.. Select the *On the network* drop-down menu to specify the protocol for downloading packages. This setting depends on the server that you want to use.
+
[WARNING]
====
The Appstream repository check box is disabled if you select *On the network* and then decide to revert to *Auto-detected installation*. You must select the Appstream check box to enable the Appstream repository.
====


.. Type the server address (without the protocol) into the address field. If you choose NFS, a second input field opens where you can specify custom *NFS mount options*. This field accepts options listed in the `nfs(5)` man page.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When selecting an NFS installation source, you must specify the address with a colon (`:`) character separating the host name from the path. For example:

[subs="quotes, macros"]
----
`pass:attributes[{blank}]_server.example.com_:pass:attributes[{blank}]_/path/to/directory_pass:attributes[{blank}]`
----
====
+
[NOTE]
====
The following steps are optional and are only required if you use a proxy for network access.
====

.. Click *Proxy setup...* to configure a proxy for an HTTP or HTTPS source.

.. Select the *Enable HTTP proxy* check box and type the URL into the *Proxy Host* field.

.. Select the *Use Authentication* check box if the proxy server requires authentication.

.. Type in your user name and password.

.. Click *OK* to finish the configuration and exit the *Proxy Setup...* dialog box.
+
[NOTE]
====
If your HTTP or HTTPS URL refers to a repository mirror menu, select the required option from the *URL type* drop-down list. All environments and add-ons are available for selection when you finish configuring the sources.
====


. Click *+* to add a repository.

. Click *-* to delete a repository.

. Click the arrow icon to revert the current entries to the setting when you opened the *Installation Source* window.

. To activate or deactivate a repository, click the check box in the *Enabled* column for each entry in the list.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can name and configure your additional repository in the same way as the primary repository on the network.
====

. Click *Done* to apply the settings and return to the *Installation Summary* window.
