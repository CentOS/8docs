= Preparing a driver disc

You can create a driver update disc on a CD or DVD. See xref:standard-install:assembly_preparing-for-your-installation.adoc#making-an-installation-cd-or-dvd_preparing-for-your-installation[Creating a bootable DVD or CD] to learn more about burning discs from image files.

After you burn a driver update disc CD or DVD, verify that the disc was created successfully by inserting it into your system and browsing to it using the file manager. You should see a single file named `rhdd3`, which is a signature file that contains the driver disc's description, and a directory named `rpms`, which contains the RPM packages with the actual drivers for various architectures.

If you see only a single file ending in `.iso`, then you have not created the disc correctly and should try again. Ensure that you choose an option similar to `Burn from Image` if you use a Linux desktop other than [application]*GNOME*, or if you use a different operating system.
