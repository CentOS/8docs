= Configuring a mount point file system

This procedure describes how to set the partitioning scheme for each mount point that was created manually. The available options are `Standard Partition`, `LVM`, and `LVM Thin Provisioning`.

[NOTE]
====
* Btfrs support has been removed in {ProductName} {ProductNumber}.
* The `/boot` partition is always located on a standard partition, regardless of the value selected.
====

.Procedure

. To change the devices that a single non-LVM mount point should be located on, select the required mount point from the left-hand pane.

. Under the *Device(s)* heading, click *Modify...*. The *Configure Mount Point* dialog opens.

. Select one or more devices and click *Select* to confirm your selection and return to the *Manual Partitioning* window.

. Click *Update Settings* to apply the changes.

[NOTE]
====
Click the *Rescan* button (circular arrow button) to refresh all local disks and partitions; this is only required after performing advanced partition configuration outside the installation program. Clicking the *Rescan Disks* button resets all configuration changes made in the installation program.
====

. In the lower left-hand side of the *Manual Partitioning* window, click the *storage device selected* link to open the *Selected Disks* dialog and review disk information.

+
// At the bottom of the screen, a link states how many storage devices have been selected in `Installation Destination` (see *sect-disk-partitioning-setup-x86*). Clicking on this link opens the `Selected Disks` dialog, where you review the information about the disks. See *sect-bootloader-x86* for more information.
