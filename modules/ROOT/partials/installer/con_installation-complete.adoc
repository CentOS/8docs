[id="installation-complete_{context}"]
= Graphical installation complete

Remove any installation media if it is not ejected automatically upon reboot.

{rel8} starts after your system's normal power-up sequence is complete. If your system was installed on a workstation with the X Window System, applications to configure your system are launched. These applications guide you through initial configuration and you can set your system time and date, and more. If the X Window System is not installed, a `login:` prompt is displayed.

To learn how to complete initial setup, register, and secure your system, see xref:standard-install:assembly_post-installation-tasks.adoc[Completing post-installation tasks].
