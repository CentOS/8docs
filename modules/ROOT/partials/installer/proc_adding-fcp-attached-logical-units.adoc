= Adding FCP-attached logical units

If running under z/VM, make certain the FCP adapter is attached to the z/VM guest virtual machine. For multipathing in production environments there would be at least two FCP devices on two different physical adapters (CHPIDs). For example:

[literal,subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
....
CP ATTACH FC00 TO *
CP ATTACH FCD0 TO *
....
