== Prerequisites

* You received the driver update ISO image from your hardware vendor, or a trusted third-party vendor.
* You burned the driver update ISO image to a CD or DVD.

[WARNING]
====
If only a single ISO image file ending in `.iso` is available on the CD or DVD, the burn process has not been successful.
See your system's burning software documentation for instructions on how to burn ISO images to a CD or DVD.

== Procedure

. Insert the driver update CD or DVD into your system's CD/DVD drive, and browse it using the system's file manager tool.

. Verify that a single file `rhdd3` is available. `rhdd3` is a signature file that contains the driver description and a directory named `rpms`, which contains the RPM packages with the actual drivers for various architectures.
