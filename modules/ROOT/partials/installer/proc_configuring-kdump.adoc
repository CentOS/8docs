= Configuring Kdump

[application]*Kdump* is a kernel crash-dumping mechanism. In the event of a system crash, *Kdump* captures the contents of the system memory at the moment of failure. This captured memory can be analyzed to find the cause of the crash. If [application]*Kdump* is enabled, it must have a small portion of the system's memory (RAM) reserved to itself. This reserved memory is not accessible to the main kernel.

= Procedure

. From the *Installation Summary* window, click *Kdump*. The *Kdump* window opens.

. Select the *Enable kdump* check box.

. Select either the *Automatic* or *Manual* memory reservation setting.

.. If you select *Manual*, enter the amount of memory (in megabytes) that you want to reserve in the *Memory to be reserved* field using the *+* and *-* buttons. The *Usable System Memory* readout below the reservation input field shows how much memory is accessible to your main system after reserving the amount of RAM that you select.

. Click *Done* to apply the settings and return to xref:standard-install:assembly_graphical-installation.adoc#installation-summary_graphical-installation[The Installation Summary window].

[NOTE]
====
The amount of memory that you reserve is determined by your system architecture (AMD64 and Intel{nbsp}64 have different requirements than IBM Power) as well as the total amount of system memory. In most cases, automatic reservation is satisfactory.

//TODO: link to somewhere that talks abotu kdump memory reservation requirements
//If you insist on manual settings, see the *LINK* for guidelines. This document also contains more in-depth information about how [application]*Kdump* works, how to configure additional settings, and how to analyze a saved crash dump.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Additional settings, such as the location where kernel crash dumps will be saved, can only be configured after the installation using either the [application]*system-config-kdump* graphical interface, or manually in the `/etc/kdump.conf` configuration file.
