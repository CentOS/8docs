= Deprecated Kickstart comands and options

The following Kickstart commands and options have been deprecated in {rel8}. Using them in Kickstart files will print a warning in the logs.

* [command]`auth` or [command]`authconfig` - use [command]`authselect instead`
* [command]`device`
* [command]`deviceprobe`
* [command]`dmraid`
* [command]`install` - use the subcommands or methods directly as commands
* [command]`lilo`
* [command]`lilocheck`
* [command]`mouse`
* [command]`multipath`
* [command]`bootloader --upgrade`
* [command]`ignoredisk --interactive`
* [command]`partition --active`
* [command]`reboot --kexec`

Where only specific options are listed, the base command and its other options are still available and not deprecated.

Note also you can turn the deprecated command warnings into errors with the [option]`inst.ksstrict` boot option.
