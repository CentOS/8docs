= Supported RAID types

RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks, a technology which allows you to combine multiple physical disks into logical units. Some setups are designed to enhance performance at the cost of reliability, while others will improve reliability at the cost of requiring more disks for the same amount of available space.

This section describes supported software RAID types which you can use with LVM and LVM Thin Provisioning to set up storage on the installed system.

None:: No RAID array will be set up.

RAID0:: Performance: Distributes data across multiple disks. RAID 0 offers increased performance over standard partitions and can be used to pool the storage of multiple disks into one large virtual device. Note that RAID 0 offers no redundancy and that the failure of one device in the array destroys data in the entire array. RAID 0 requires at least two disks.

RAID1:: Redundancy: Mirrors all data from one partition onto one or more other disks. Additional devices in the array provide increasing levels of redundancy. RAID 1 requires at least two disks.

RAID4:: Error checking: Distributes data across multiple disks and uses one disk in the array to store parity information which safeguards the array in case any disk in the array fails. As all parity information is stored on one disk, access to this disk creates a "bottleneck" in the arrayâ€™s performance. RAID 4 requires at least three disks.

RAID5:: Distributed error checking: Distributes data and parity information across multiple disks. RAID 5 offers the performance advantages of distributing data across multiple disks, but does not share the performance bottleneck of RAID 4 as the parity information is also distributed through the array. RAID 5 requires at least three disks.

RAID6:: Redundant error checking: RAID 6 is similar to RAID 5, but instead of storing only one set of parity data, it stores two sets. RAID 6 requires at least four disks.

RAID10:: Performance and redundancy: RAID 10 is nested or hybrid RAID. It is constructed by distributing data over mirrored sets of disks. For example, a RAID 10 array constructed from four RAID partitions consists of two mirrored pairs of striped partitions. RAID 10 requires at least four disks.
