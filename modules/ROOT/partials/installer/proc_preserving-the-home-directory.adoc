// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_preserving-the-home-directory.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Preserving the /home directory

In a {rel8} graphical installation, you can preserve the [filename]`/home` directory that was used on your {rel7} system.

WARNING: Preserving [filename]`/home` is only possible if the [filename]`/home` directory is located on a separate `/home` partition on your {rel7} system.

Preserving the [filename]`/home` directory that includes various configuration settings, makes it possible that the GNOME Shell environment on the new rel8 system is set in the same way as it was on your {rel7} system.
Note that this applies only for users on {rel8} with the same user name and ID as on the previous {rel7} system.

Complete this procedure to preserve the [filename]`/home` directory from your {rel8} system.

[discrete]
== Prerequisites

* {rel7} system is installed on your computer.
* The [filename]`/home` directory is located on a separate `/home` partition on your {rel7} system.
* The {rel8} `Installation Summary` window is currently displayed.
// * You can also link to other modules or assemblies the user must follow before starting this assembly.
// * Delete the section title and bullets if the assembly has no prerequisites.

== Procedure

. Click `Installation Destination` to open the `Installation Destination` window.

. Under `Storage Configuration`, select the `Custom` radio button. Click `Done`.

. Click `Done`, the `Manual Partitioning` window opens.

. Choose the `/home` partition, fill in `/home` under `Mount Point:` and clear the `Reformat` check box.

. Optional: You can also customize various aspects of the `/home` partition required for your {rel8} system as described in xref:standard-install:assembly_graphical-installation.adoc#customizing-a-partition-or-volume_manual-partitioning[Customizing a partition or volume]. However, to preserve `/home` from your {rel7} system, it is necessary to clear the `Reformat` check box.

. After you customized all partitions according to your requirements, click `Done`. The `Summary of changes` dialog box opens.

. Verify that the `Summary of changes` dialog box does not show any change for `/home`. This means that the `/home` partition is preserved.

. Click `Accept Changes` to apply the changes, and return to the `Installation Summary` window.
