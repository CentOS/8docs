// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/ref_deprecated-boot-options.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: ref_my-reference-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='ref_my-reference-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My reference A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.

= Deprecated boot options

This section contains information about deprecated boot options. These options are still accepted by the installation program but they are deprecated and are scheduled to be removed in a future release of {productname}.

method::
The `method` option is an alias for `inst.repo`.

repo=nfsiso::
The `repo=nfsiso:` option is the same as `inst.repo=nfs:`.

dns::
Use `nameserver` instead of `dns`. Note that nameserver does not accept comma-separated lists; use multiple nameserver options instead.

netmask, gateway, hostname::

The `netmask`, `gateway`, and `hostname` options are provided as part of the `ip` option.

ip=bootif::
A PXE-supplied `BOOTIF` option is used automatically, so there is no requirement to use `ip=bootif`.

ksdevice::
+
