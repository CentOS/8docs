= Choose an installation boot method

There are several methods to boot the {productname} installation program. The method you choose depends on your installation media.

Full installation DVD or USB flash drive::
Create a full installation DVD or USB flash drive using the *DVD1 ISO* image. The DVD or USB flash drive can be used as a boot device and as an installation source for installing software packages. Due to the size of the DVD1 ISO image, a DVD or USB flash drive are the recommended media types.

Minimal installation DVD, CD, or USB flash drive::
Create a minimal installation CD, DVD, or USB flash drive using the *Boot ISO* image, which contains only the minimum files necessary to boot the system and start the installation program. The *Boot ISO* image requires an installation source that contains the required software packages.

PXE Server::
A _preboot execution environment_ (PXE) server allows the installation program to boot over the network. After a system boot, you must complete the installation from a different installation source, such as a local hard drive or a network location.
