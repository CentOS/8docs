= Anaconda configuration section

Additional installation options can be configured in the `%anaconda` section of your Kickstart file. This section controls the behavior of the user interface of the installation system.

This section must be placed towards the end of the Kickstart file, after Kickstart commands, and must start with `%anaconda` and end with `%end`.

Currently, the only command that can be used in the `%anaconda` section is [command]`pwpolicy`.

.Sample `%anaconda` script
====

The following is an example %anaconda section:

----
%anaconda
pwpolicy root --minlen=10 --strict
%end
----

This example `%anaconda` section sets a password policy which requires that the root password be at least 10 characters long, and strictly forbids passwords which do not match this requirement.
