= Downloading an ISO image from the Customer Portal

//TODO:Add list of packages available from the RHEL 8 manifest

Follow this procedure to download a {productname} {productnumber} ISO image from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

[NOTE]
====
* Red Hat recommends using the Binary DVD ISO image to install {ProductName} {productnumber} as it contains all repositories and software packages, and does not require any additional configuration.
* If you download the Boot ISO image file, you must configure an installation source to obtain the repositories and software packages.

See for more information.
