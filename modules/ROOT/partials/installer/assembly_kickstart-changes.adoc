The folowing sections describe the changes in Kickstart commands and options in {rel8}.

== auth or authconfig is deprecated in {rel8}
The `auth` or `authconfig` Kickstart command is deprecated in {productname} 8 because the `authconfig` tool and package have been removed.

Similarly to `authconfig` commands issued on command line, `authconfig` commands in Kickstart scripts now use the `authselect-compat` tool to run the new `authselect` tool. For a description of this compatibility layer and its known issues, see the manual page `authselect-migration(7)`. The installation program will automatically detect use of the deprecated commands and install on the system the `authselect-compat` package to provide the compatibility layer.

// The `auth` or `authconfig` Kickstart command sets up the authentication options for the system using the `authconfig` command, which can also be run on the command line after the installation finishes.


== Kickstart no longer supports Btrfs
The Btrfs file system is not supported in {productname} 8. As a result, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the Kickstart commands no longer support Btrfs.

== Using Kickstart files from previous {ProductName} releases
If you are using Kickstart files from previous releases, see the xref:managing-userspace-components:index.adoc[Installing, managing, and removing user space components] document for more information about the {productname} 8 BaseOS and AppStream repositories.
