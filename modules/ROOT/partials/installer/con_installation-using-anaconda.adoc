Installation using Anaconda

In the second installation phase, you will use the [application]*Anaconda* installation program in graphical, text-based, or command-line mode:

Graphical Mode::
+
Graphical installation is done through a VNC client. You can use your mouse and keyboard to navigate through the screens, click buttons, and type into text fields.

Text-based Mode::
+
Use this for interactive installations if you cannot use a VNC client. Features such as customizing partition layout, or package add-on selection, are only available with the graphical user interface installation.

Command-line Mode::
+
This is intended for automated and non-interactive installations on System{nbsp}z. Note that if the installation program encounters an invalid or missing kickstart command, the system will reboot.
