= Performing a remote installation in VNC Connect mode

Use this procedure to perform a remote {rel8} installation in VNC Connect mode. In Connect mode, the target system that is being installed with {ProductName} initiates a connect to the VNC viewer that is installed on another system. In this procedure, the system with the VNC viewer is called the *remote* system.

[NOTE]
====
This procedure uses *TigerVNC* as the VNC viewer. Specific instructions for other viewers might differ, but the general principles apply.

== Prerequisites

* As root, you have installed a VNC viewer on a remote system, for example:
+
----
# yum install tigervnc
----
+
* You have set up a network boot server to start the installation on the target system. For more information, see xref:advanced-install:assembly_preparing-for-a-network-install.adoc[Preparing to install from the network using PXE].

* You have configured the target system to use the boot options for a VNC Connect installation. For more information, see *add link to updated boot options when they are ready*.

* You have verified that the remote system with the VNC viewer is configured to accept an incoming connection on the required port. Verification is dependent on your network and system configuration. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/security_hardening/index[Security hardening in RHEL 8] and https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/securing_networks/index/[Securing networks in RHEL 8] documents.

== Procedure

. Start the VNC viewer on the remote system in _listening mode_ by running the following command:
+
----
$ vncviewer -listen PORT
----
+
. Replace PORT with the port number used for the connection.

. The terminal displays a message indicating that it is waiting for an incoming connection from the target system.

. Boot the target system from the network.

. From the {ProductName} boot menu on the target system, press the `Tab` key on your keyboard to edit the boot options.

. Append the `inst.vnc inst.vncconnect=HOST:PORT` option to the end of the command line.

. Replace _HOST_ with the IP address of the remote system that is running the listening VNC viewer, and _PORT_ with the port number that the VNC viewer is listening on.

. Press *Enter* to start the installation. The system initializes the installation program and starts the necessary services. When the initialization process is finished, the installation program attempts to connect to the IP address and port provided.

. When the connection is successful, a new window opens with the VNC connection established, displaying the {rel8} installation menu. From this window, you can install {rel8} on the target system using the graphical user interface.
