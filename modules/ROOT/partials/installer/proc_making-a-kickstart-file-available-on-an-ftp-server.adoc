= Making a Kickstart file available on an FTP server

This procedure describes how to store the Kickstart script file on an FTP server. This method enables you to install multiple systems from a single source without having to use physical media for the Kickstart file.


.Prerequisites

* You must have administrator level access to a server with {rel8} on the local network.
* The system to be installed must be able to connect to the server.
* Firewall on the server must allow connections from the system you are installing to. See xref:assembly_making-kickstart-files-available-to-the-installation-program.adoc#ports-for-network-based-installation_making-kickstart-files-available-to-the-installation-program[Ports for network-based installation] for more information.

.Procedure

. Install the [package]`vsftpd` package by running the following command as root:
+
----
# yum install vsftpd
----

. Open and edit the [filename]`/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf` configuration file in a text editor.

.. Change the line `anonymous_enable=NO` to `anonymous_enable=YES`

.. Change the line `write_enable=YES` to `write_enable=NO`.

.. Add lines `pasv_min_port=__min_port__` and `pasv_max_port=__max_port__`. Replace __min_port__ and __max_port__ with the port number range used by FTP server in passive mode, e. g. `10021` and `10031`.
+
This step can be necessary in network environments featuring various firewall/NAT setups.

.. Optionally, add custom changes to your configuration. For available options, see the *vsftpd.conf(5)* man page. This procedure assumes that default options are used.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you configured SSL/TLS security in your [filename]`vsftpd.conf` file, ensure that you enable only the TLSv1 protocol, and disable SSLv2 and SSLv3. This is due to the POODLE SSL vulnerability (CVE-2014-3566). See https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1234773 for details.
====

. Configure the server firewall.

.. Enable the firewall:
+
----
# systemctl enable firewalld
# systemctl start firewalld
----

.. Enable in your firewall the FTP port and port range from previous step:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
# firewall-cmd --add-port __min_port__-__max_port__/tcp --permanent
# firewall-cmd --add-service ftp --permanent
# firewall-cmd --reload
----
+
Replace __min_port__-__max_port__ with the port numbers you entered into the [filename]`/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf` configuration file.

. Copy the Kickstart file to the FTP server into the [filename]`/var/ftp/` directory or its subdirectory.

. Make sure that the correct SELinux context and access mode is set on the file:
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
# restorecon -r /var/ftp/__your-kickstart-file.ks__
# chmod 444 /var/ftp/__your-kickstart-file.ks__
----

. Start the `vsftpd` service:
+
----
# systemctl start vsftpd.service
----
+
If the service was running before you changed the [filename]`/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf` file, restart the service to load the edited file:
+
----
# systemctl restart vsftpd.service
----
+
The Kickstart file is now accessible and ready to be used for installations by systems on the same network.
+
[NOTE]
====
When configuring the installation source, use `ftp://` as the protocol, the server's host name or IP address, and the path of the Kickstart file, relative to the FTP server root. For example, if the server's host name is `myserver.example.com` and you have copied the file to `/var/ftp/my-ks.cfg`, specify `ftp://myserver.example.com/my-ks.cfg` as the installation source.
