= Removed Kickstart comands and options

The following Kickstart commands and options have been completely removed in {RHEL8}. Using them in Kickstart files will cause an error.

* [command]`upgrade` (This command had already previously been deprecated.)
* [command]`btrfs`
* [command]`part/partition btrfs`
* [command]`part --fstype btrfs` or [command]`partition --fstype btrfs`
* [command]`logvol --fstype btrfs`
* [command]`raid --fstype btrfs`
