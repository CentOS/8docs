= Adding an LCS device

The _LAN channel station_ (LCS) device driver supports 1000Base-T Ethernet on the OSA-Express2 and OSA-Express 3 features.

The `LCS` device driver assigns the following interface name for OSA-Express Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet devices: `enca`pass:attributes[{blank}]pass:attributes[{blank}]_bus_ID_. The bus ID is composed of the channel subsystem ID, subchannel set ID, and device number, for example `enca00`.
