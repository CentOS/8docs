= Booting the installation from a network using PXE

Follow the steps in this procedure to boot the {productname} installation from a network using PXE.

[discrete]
== Prerequisites

* You have configured a TFTP server, and there is a network interface in your system that supports PXE. See *Additional resources* for more information.
* You have configured your system to boot from the network interface. This option is in the BIOS, and can be labeled *Network Boot* or *Boot Services*.
* You have verified that the BIOS is configured to boot from the specified network interface. Some BIOS systems specify the network interface as a possible boot device, but do not support the PXE standard. See your hardware's documentation for more information. When you have properly enabled PXE booting, the system can boot the {rel8} installation program without any other media.

== Procedure

[NOTE]
====
To boot the installation process from a network using PXE, you must use a physical network connection, for example, Ethernet. You cannot boot the installation process with a wireless connection.
====

. Verify that the network cable is attached. The link indicator light on the network socket should be lit, even if the computer is not switched on.

. Switch on the system.
+
Depending on your hardware, some network setup and diagnostic information can be displayed before your system connects to a PXE server. When connected, a menu is displayed according to the PXE server configuration.
+
. Press the number key that corresponds to the option that you require.
+
[NOTE]
====
In some instances, boot options are not displayed. If this occurs, press the *Enter* key on your keyboard or wait until the boot window opens.
====
The *{rel8} boot* window opens and displays information about a variety of available boot options.
+
. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to select the boot option that you require, and press *Enter* to select the boot option.
The *Welcome to {rel8}* window opens and you can install {productname} using the graphical user interface.
+
[NOTE]
====
The installation program automatically begins if no action is performed in the boot window within 60 seconds.
====
+
. Optional: For UEFI-based systems, press *E* to edit the available boot options. For BIOS-based systems, press the *Tab* key on your keyboard to edit the available boot options. The boot window enters edit mode and you can change the predefined command line to add or remove boot options.
