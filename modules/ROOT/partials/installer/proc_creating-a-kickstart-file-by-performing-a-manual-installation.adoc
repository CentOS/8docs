= Creating a Kickstart file by performing a manual installation

The recommended approach to creating Kickstart files is to use the file created by a manual installation of {ProductName}. After an installation completes, all choices made during the installation are saved into a Kickstart file named [filename]`anaconda-ks.cfg`, located in the [filename]`/root/` directory on the installed system. You can use this file to reproduce the installation in the same way as before. Alternatively, copy this file, make any changes you need, and use the resulting configuration file for further installations.


.Procedure

. Install {rel8}. For more details, see xref:standard-install:index.adoc[Performing a standard installation].
+
During the installation, create a user with administrator privileges.

. Finish the installation and reboot into the installed system.

. Log into the system with the administrator account.

. Copy the file [filename]`/root/anaconda-ks.cfg` to a location of your choice.
+
====
* To display the file contents in terminal:
+
----
# cat /root/anaconda-ks.cfg
----
+
You can copy the output and save to another file of your choice.

* To copy the file to another location, use the file manager. Remember to change permissions on the copy, so that the file can be read by non-root users.

CAUTION: The file contains information about users and passwords.
