= Configuring localization options

This section contains information about configuring your keyboard, language support, and time and date settings.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you use a layout that cannot accept Latin characters, such as *Russian*, add the *English (United States)* layout and configure a keyboard combination to switch between the two layouts. If you select only a layout that does not have Latin characters, you might be unable to enter a valid [systemitem]`root` password and user credentials later in the installation process. This can prevent you from completing the installation.

The list of cities and regions come from the Time Zone Database ([package]`tzdata`) public domain that is maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). {OrgName} can not add cities or regions to this database. You can find more information at the link:++http://www.iana.org/time-zones++[IANA official website].
====

.. From the *Region* drop-down menu, select a region.
+
[NOTE]
====
Select *Etc* as your region to configure a time zone relative to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) without setting your location to a specific region.
====

.. From the *City* drop-down menu, select the city, or the city closest to your location in the same time zone.

.. Toggle the *Network Time* switch to enable or disable network time synchronization using the Network Time Protocol (NTP).

Enabling the Network Time switch keeps your system time correct as long as the system can access the internet. By default, one NTP pool is configured; you can add a new option, or disable or remove the default options by clicking the gear wheel button next to the btn:[Network Time] switch.
====

.. Click *Done* to apply the changes and return to xref:standard-install:assembly_graphical-installation.adoc#installation-summary_graphical-installation[The Installation Summary window].
