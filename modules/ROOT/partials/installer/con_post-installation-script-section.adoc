= Post-installation script section

You have the option of adding commands to run on the system once the installation is complete, but before the system is rebooted for the first time. This section must start with `%post` and end with `%end`.

The `%post` section is useful for functions such as installing additional software or configuring an additional name server. The post-install script is run in a `chroot` environment, therefore, performing tasks such as copying scripts or RPM packages from the installation media do not work by default. You can change this behavior using the `--nochroot` option as described below. Then the `%post` script will run in the installation environment, not in `chroot` on the installed target system.

Because post-install script runs in a `chroot` environment, most `systemctl` commands will refuse to perform any action. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_basic_system_settings/managing-services-with-systemd_configuring-basic-system-settings#behavior_of_systemctl_in_a_chroot_environment[Behavior of systemctl in a chroot Environment] section of the _Configuring and managing system administration in RHEL 8_ document.

Note that during execution of the `%post` section, the installation media must be still inserted.

[IMPORTANT]
If you configured the network with static IP information, including a name server, you can access the network and resolve IP addresses in the `%post` section. If you configured the network for DHCP, the [filename]`/etc/resolv.conf` file has not been completed when the installation executes the `%post` section. You can access the network, but you cannot resolve IP addresses. Thus, if you are using DHCP, you must specify IP addresses in the `%post` section.
