= Automatic driver update

To have the installation program automatically recognize a driver update disc, connect a block device with the `OEMDRV` volume label to your computer before starting the installation process.

//[NOTE]
//====

//Starting with {ProductName}{nbsp}7.2, you can also use the `OEMDRV` block device to automatically load a Kickstart file. This file must be named `ks.cfg` and placed in the root of the device to be loaded. See <<chap-kickstart-installations>> for more information about Kickstart installations.

//====

When the installation begins, the installation program detects all available storage connected to the system. If it finds a storage device labeled `OEMDRV`, it will treat it as a driver update disc and attempt to load driver updates from this device. You will be prompted to select which drivers to load:
