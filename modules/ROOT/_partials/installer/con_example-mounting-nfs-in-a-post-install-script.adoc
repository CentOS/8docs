= Example: Mounting NFS in a post-install script

This example of a `%post` section mounts an NFS share and executes a script named `runme` located at `/usr/new-machines/` on the share. Note that NFS file locking is not supported while in Kickstart mode, therefore the `-o nolock` option is required.

----
# Start of the %post section with logging into /root/ks-post.log
%post --log=/root/ks-post.log

# Mount an NFS share
mkdir /mnt/temp
mount -o nolock 10.10.0.2:/usr/new-machines /mnt/temp
openvt -s -w -- /mnt/temp/runme
umount /mnt/temp

# End of the %post section
%end
