The boot menu provides several options in addition to launching the installation program. If no key is pressed within 60 seconds, the default boot option (the one highlighted in white) will be run. To choose the default, either wait for the timer to run out or press kbd:[Enter].


* *Install {ProductName}{nbsp}8.0*:
Choose this option to install {ProductName} onto your computer system using the graphical installation program see
//<<graphical-installation-workflow_graphical-installation>>.

* *Test this media & install {ProductName}{nbsp}8.0*:
This option is the default. Prior to starting the installation program, a utility is launched to check the integrity of the installation media.

To select a different option than the default, use the arrow keys on your keyboard, and press kbd:[Enter] when the correct option is highlighted.

To customize the boot options for a particular menu entry, press the kbd:[e] key and add custom boot options to the command line. When ready press kbd:[Ctrl + X] to boot the modified option.



* *Troubleshooting `>`*: This is a separate menu containing options that help resolve various installation issues. When highlighted, press kbd:[Enter] to display its contents.

* *Install {ProductName}{nbsp}8.0 in basic graphics mode*:
This option allows you to install {ProductName} in graphical mode even if the installation program is unable to load the correct driver for your video card. If your screen appears distorted or goes blank when using the `Install {ProductName}{nbsp}8.0` option, restart your computer and try this option instead.

* *Rescue a {ProductName} system*: Choose this option to repair a problem with your installed {ProductName} system that prevents you from booting normally. The rescue environment contains utility programs that allow you fix a wide variety of these problems.

* *Run a memory test*:
This option runs a memory test on your system. For more information, see
// <<sect-boot-options-memtest>>.

* *Boot from local drive*:
This option boots the system from the first installed disk. If you booted this disc accidentally, use this option to boot from the hard disk immediately without starting the installation program.
