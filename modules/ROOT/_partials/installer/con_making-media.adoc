= Creating installation media

This section contains information about using the ISO image file that you downloaded in <<downloading-beta-installation-images_preparing-for-your-installation>>
to create bootable physical installation media, such as a USB, DVD, or CD.

//TODOFor instructions on how to set up a _Preboot Execution Environment_ (PXE) server to perform a PXE-based installation over a network, //see
//<<chap-installation-server-setup>>.

[NOTE]
====
By default, the [option]`inst.stage2=` boot option is used on the installation media and is set to a specific label, for example, [option]`inst.stage2=hd:LABEL=RHEL8\x86_64`. If you modify the default label of the file system containing the runtime image, or if you use a customized procedure to boot the installation system, you must verify that the label is set to the correct value.

//TODO:See <<list-boot-options-sources>> for details.
