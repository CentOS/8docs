= Manual driver update

For manual driver installation, prepare an ISO image file containing your drivers to an accessible location, such a USB flash drive or a web server, and connect it to your computer. At the welcome screen, press kbd:[Tab] to display the boot command line and append the [option]`inst.dd=pass:attributes[{blank}]_location_pass:attributes[{blank}]` to it, where _location_ is a path to the driver update disc:

Typically, the image file is located on a web server (for example, _http://server.example.com/dd.iso_) or on a USB flash drive (for example, _/dev/sdb1_). It is also possible to specify an RPM package containing the driver update (for example _http://server.example.com/dd.rpm_).

When ready, press kbd:[Enter] to execute the boot command. Then, your selected drivers will be loaded and the installation process will proceed normally
