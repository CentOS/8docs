// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/ref_installer-networking.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: ref_my-reference-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='ref_my-reference-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My reference A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.

== Device naming scheme

A new network device naming scheme that generates network interface names based on a user-defined prefix is available in {productname} 8.
The `net.ifnames.prefix` boot option allows the device naming scheme to be used by the installation program and the installed system. See the `dracut.cmdline(7)` man page for information.
