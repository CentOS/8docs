.Installation summary

image::anaconda-summary-hub-rhel8.png["The Installation Summary window, showing most of the options configured. The Installation Destination icon has a warning sign, which means it requires  user attention before the installation can proceed."]


The *Installation Summary* window contains three categories:

* *LOCALIZATION*: You can configure Keyboard, Language Support, and Time and Date.

* *SOFTWARE*: You can configure Installation Source and Software Selection.

* *SYSTEM*: You can configure Installation Destination, KDUMP, Network and Host Name, Security Policy, and System Purpose.

A category can have a different status depending on where it is in the installation program.

.Category status
[options="header"]
|===
| Category status | Status | Description
| *Warning symbol type 1* | Yellow triangle with an exclamation mark and red text | Requires attention before installation. For example, *Installation Destination* requires attention as you must confirm the default automatic partitioning variant.
| *Warning symbol type 2* | Grayed out and with a warning symbol (yellow triangle with an exclamation mark) | The installation program is configuring a category and you must wait for it to finish before accessing the window.
|===

[NOTE]
====
A warning message is displayed at the bottom of the *Installation Summary* window and the *Begin Installation* button is disabled  until you configure all of the required categories.
