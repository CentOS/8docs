* BIOS/firmware RAID devices
* NVDIMM devices in sector mode on the Intel64 and AMD64 architectures, supported by the nd_pmem driver.
* Fibre Channel Host Bus Adapters and multipath devices. Some can require vendor-provided drivers.
* Xen block devices on Intel processors in Xen virtual machines.
* VirtIO block devices on Intel processors in KVM virtual machines.
