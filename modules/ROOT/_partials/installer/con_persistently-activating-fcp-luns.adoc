= Persistently activating FCP LUNs

The above instructions described how to activate FCP LUNs dynamically in a running system. However, such changes are not persistent and do not survive a reboot. How you make the changes to the FCP configuration persistent in your Linux system depends on whether the FCP LUNs belong to the root file system. Those required for the root file system need to be activated very early during the boot process by the `initramfs` to be able to mount the root file system. The [command]`cio_ignore` commands are handled transparently for persistent device configurations and you do not need to free devices from the ignore list manually.
