// * Title: = My assembly A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module.

// In order for  the assembly to be reusable in other assemblies in a guide,
// include {context} in the ID: [id='a-collection-of-modules_{context}'].

// If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund

// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID
// includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if
