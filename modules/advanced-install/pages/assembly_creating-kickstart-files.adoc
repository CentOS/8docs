:context: creating-kickstart-files

You can create a Kickstart file using the following methods:

* Use the online Kickstart configuration tool.

* Copy the Kickstart file created as a result of a manual installation.

* Write the entire Kickstart file manually. Note that editing an already existing file from the other methods is faster, so this method is not recommended.

// If needed, you can manually edit the Kickstart file and change the installation options.

Note that some highly specific installation options can be configured only by manual editing of the Kickstart file.
