Besides individual RPM packages, the AppStream repository contains modules. A module is a set of RPM packages that represent a component and are usually installed together. A typical module contains packages with an application, packages with the application-specific dependency libraries, packages with documentation for the application, and packages with helper utilities.

The subsequent sections describe further features for organization and handling of content within modules:

* Streams - organization of content by version. For more details see xref:module-streams_{context}[].
* Profiles - organization of content by purpose. For more details see xref:module-profiles_{context}[].
